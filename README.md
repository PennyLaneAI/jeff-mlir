## An MLIR dialect for the *jeff* exchange format

This repository is contains an MLIR dialect for the [*jeff* exchange format](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/jeff).
The purpose is to facilitate conversion to and from *jeff* for MLIR-based quantum compilers, and
reuse certain components like the jeff serialization & deserialization.

Right now, the project only contains the dialect definitions, (de)serialization is missing.
Conversion rules to and from standard MLIR dialects could also be added.

## Build instructions

The dialect sources can be incorporated directly into an existing project (in-tree), or built
separately (out-of-tree). At the moment, the CMake script supports building the dialect as a
standalone project which generates a custom `opt` tool.

To do so, make sure you have an existing MLIR build.

You can get pre-built binaries from the [munich-quantum-software/portable-mlir-toolchain](https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/portable-mlir-toolchain) project via the installers from [munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir](https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir):

On Linux and macOS, use the following Bash command:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir/releases/latest/download/setup-mlir.sh | bash -s -- -v 21.1.8 -p /path/to/installation
```

On Windows, use the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir/releases/latest/download/setup-mlir.ps1))) -llvm_version 21.1.8 -install_prefix /path/to/installation"
```

Replace `/path/to/installation` with the path to your preferred installation directory.
Then, set `MLIR_DIR` to `/path/to/installation/lib/cmake/mlir` in your CMake configuration step.
The project hosts a variety of pre-built binaries for different platforms and LLVM versions.
Check out the [project page](https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir) for more details.

Alternatively, you can build MLIR from source following the instructions in the [MLIR documentation](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/), which are summarized below.
First, clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git external/llvm-project
```
Then, build and run the MLIR test suite:
```sh
cd external/llvm-project
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja            \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release        \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir"     \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF         \
      -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON       \
      -DMLIR_ENABLE_BINDINGS_PYTHON=OFF
cmake --build build --target check-mlir
```
Finally, you can point the `MLIR_DIR` variable to `external/llvm-project/build/lib/cmake/mlir` in your CMake configuration step.

From here, we can build the *jeff* dialect simply via:
```sh
cmake -Bbuild -S. -GNinja && cmake --build build
```

If CMake can't find the MLIR build, it can be specified via `-DMLIR_DIR=...` during the config step,
which must point to the cmake files in the build or installation directory, for example
`/path/to/installation/lib/cmake/mlir`.

The `jeff-opt` tool will be located in the build directory under `./build/lib/opt/jeff-opt`.

TODO: Add instructions for setting up the dialect as an MLIR plugin.
